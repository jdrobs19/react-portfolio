                    <p>I'm not good at talking about myself. I like to be outdoors, at times, but a majority of my time is spent with my wife and daughter. I play video games and watch movies.
                    I'm working on bettering myself both physically and mentally. Currently, developing skills of a full-stack developer using the MERN stack. Enjoy front end work and database work.
